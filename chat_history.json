Station Operation: The app records parcel arrivals, sorting, and dispatch, ensuring efficient route assignment and task management. Parcel Signing: Consignees can complete the signing of parcels through QR code scanning or manual input, ensuring timely delivery confirmation. Exception Handling: The app allows couriers to record and manage parcel abnormalities in real-time, handling any unexpected issues promptly. Data Statistics: Users can access data statistics and user information displays to understand overall logistics performance and improve management.

You want to create a delivery driver app for your delivery service, \"My Nextdoor Delivery.\" The app should streamline the logistics process for last-mile couriers and include features like delivery block scheduling, turn-by-turn navigation, package scanning, and delivery confirmation. You've also outlined specific functionalities such as Parcel Pickup, Station Operation, Parcel Signing, Exception Handling, and Data Statistics. You've provided a logo for \"Nextdoor Delivery\" and want the first screen to be a login screen with the logo displayed at the top.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Login Screen:** Implement a login screen with the \"My Nextdoor Delivery\" logo prominently displayed.\n*   **Delivery Block Scheduling:** Create a screen where drivers can view and schedule available delivery blocks.\n*   **Turn-by-Turn Navigation:** Integrate a navigation system that provides turn-by-turn directions to each delivery destination.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: #F5F5F5 (Light gray)\n    *   Text: #333333 (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: #666666 (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: #FF7F50 (Coral, based on the logo)\n    *   Secondary: #6495ED (Cornflower blue, a complementary color to coral)\n    *   Accent: #90EE90 (Light green, for highlights and confirmations)\n    *   Card: #FFFFFF (White)\n    *   Highlight: #FFDAB9 (Peachpuff, a lighter shade of coral for subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan. I will instruct the coding agent to:\n\n1.  Create a basic login screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file, incorporating the \"My Nextdoor Delivery\" logo at the top. Since I don't have the image file path, I will ask the coding agent to add a placeholder for now.\n2.  Add a placeholder screen for \"Delivery Block Scheduling\" and \"Turn-by-Turn Navigation\" within the app. These can be simple screens with a title for now.\n3.  Modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n4.  Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nAfter these initial steps, we can iterate and add more features and refine the design.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T01:27:52.374869"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive delivery driver app for \"My Nextdoor Delivery\".
