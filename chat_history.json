Station Operation: The app records parcel arrivals, sorting, and dispatch, ensuring efficient route assignment and task management. Parcel Signing: Consignees can complete the signing of parcels through QR code scanning or manual input, ensuring timely delivery confirmation. Exception Handling: The app allows couriers to record and manage parcel abnormalities in real-time, handling any unexpected issues promptly. Data Statistics: Users can access data statistics and user information displays to understand overall logistics performance and improve management.

You want to create a delivery driver app for your delivery service, \"My Nextdoor Delivery.\" The app should streamline the logistics process for last-mile couriers and include features like delivery block scheduling, turn-by-turn navigation, package scanning, and delivery confirmation. You've also outlined specific functionalities such as Parcel Pickup, Station Operation, Parcel Signing, Exception Handling, and Data Statistics. You've provided a logo for \"Nextdoor Delivery\" and want the first screen to be a login screen with the logo displayed at the top.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Login Screen:** Implement a login screen with the \"My Nextdoor Delivery\" logo prominently displayed.\n*   **Delivery Block Scheduling:** Create a screen where drivers can view and schedule available delivery blocks.\n*   **Turn-by-Turn Navigation:** Integrate a navigation system that provides turn-by-turn directions to each delivery destination.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: #F5F5F5 (Light gray)\n    *   Text: #333333 (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: #666666 (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: #FF7F50 (Coral, based on the logo)\n    *   Secondary: #6495ED (Cornflower blue, a complementary color to coral)\n    *   Accent: #90EE90 (Light green, for highlights and confirmations)\n    *   Card: #FFFFFF (White)\n    *   Highlight: #FFDAB9 (Peachpuff, a lighter shade of coral for subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan. I will instruct the coding agent to:\n\n1.  Create a basic login screen in the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file, incorporating the \"My Nextdoor Delivery\" logo at the top. Since I don't have the image file path, I will ask the coding agent to add a placeholder for now.\n2.  Add a placeholder screen for \"Delivery Block Scheduling\" and \"Turn-by-Turn Navigation\" within the app. These can be simple screens with a title for now.\n3.  Modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n4.  Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nAfter these initial steps, we can iterate and add more features and refine the design.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T01:27:52.374869"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a comprehensive delivery driver app for \"My Nextdoor Delivery\".

Now let me create a summary document to explain the changes:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully modified the My Nextdoor Delivery driver app to ensure that **route planning and package amounts are handled exclusively by dispatch**. Here are the key changes:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n**1. Updated Context (AppContext.tsx):**\n- Removed the `addDelivery` function from the context - drivers can no longer create new deliveries\n- Added `packageCount` and `routeOrder` fields to the Delivery interface (assigned by dispatch)\n- Modified `updateDelivery` to prevent drivers from modifying dispatch-controlled fields like `packageCount`, `routeOrder`, `packageNumber`, `address`, and `recipient`\n- All deliveries now come pre-assigned with route order and package counts from dispatch\n\n**2. Updated Home Screen (index.tsx):**\n- Removed \"Scan Package\" from Quick Actions\n- Replaced with \"View Route\" action that takes drivers to their assigned deliveries\n- Added a dispatch notice banner: \"Your route and packages are assigned by dispatch\"\n- Updated statistics to show \"Total Packages\" (calculated from dispatch-assigned package counts) instead of allowing drivers to add packages\n- Activity feed now shows package counts when multiple packages are at one stop\n\n**3. Updated Deliveries Screen (deliveries.tsx):**\n- Added route order badges (#1, #2, #3, etc.) showing the dispatch-optimized sequence\n- Deliveries are automatically sorted by route order assigned by dispatch\n- Added a notice banner: \"Route optimized by dispatch\"\n- Package count is displayed prominently when multiple packages are assigned to a stop\n- All delivery information is read-only (drivers can only update status and add proof of delivery)\n\n**4. Updated Navigation Screen (navigation.tsx):**\n- Added dispatch notice: \"Route optimized by dispatch team\"\n- Shows the stop number in the optimized route\n- Displays package count assigned by dispatch\n- Navigation is informational only - routes are pre-planned by dispatch\n\n**5. Disabled Scan Package Screen (scan-package.tsx):**\n- Completely replaced the scanning functionality with a \"Dispatch-Only Feature\" message\n- Explains that package scanning and route assignment are managed by dispatch\n- Lists what drivers CAN do (view deliveries, follow route, complete deliveries, report issues)\n- Provides a clear back button to return to the main app\n\n### What Drivers Can Do:\n- View their assigned deliveries (with route order)\n- Follow the optimized route planned by dispatch\n- Start and complete deliveries\n- Take proof of delivery photos\n- Report issues\n- View statistics\n\n### What Drivers CANNOT Do:\n- Add new packages/deliveries\n- Modify package counts\n- Change route order\n- Edit delivery addresses or recipient information\n- Scan packages to create new deliveries\n\nAll route planning and package management is now exclusively controlled by the dispatch team, while drivers focus on executing the pre-planned routes efficiently."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "6f0f1a035cc1fe18663012004ec46aa717893748", "message": "feat: Restrict driver access to route planning and package amounts", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T02:09:09Z", "files_changed": ["app/scan-package.tsx", "app/(tabs)/deliveries.tsx", "app/navigation.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "contexts/AppContext.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "600ad8d9139293391a4de01dbd2689ff0cedfd9c"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-23T02:04:32Z"}]
